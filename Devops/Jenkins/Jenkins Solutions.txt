Assignment 1:

1) https://github.com/Suchendra-jpg/july9th.git  (repo link)

2) Add a webhook to above repository  in github.  // http://3.94.88.20:8080/github-webhook/

3) Create a freestyle project in Jenkins with below configurations:
	a) SCM - git -> repo link
	b) Build steps -> execute shell -> mkdir -p /tmp/pullcode
                                       git clone -b master https://github.com/Suchendra-jpg/july9th.git /tmp/pullcode
									
4) Make changes to the repo and you can see build being triggered automatically and extracted code to pullcode directory as expected.

5) Verify with below commands in deployed instance on which jenkins is running:
	a) cd /tmp/pullcode
	b) ls                                  //latest hello.java file present
	

Assignment 2:

1) We would require total of three ec2 instances to perform the task , these would be the name of our instances:
	a) master 
	b) test
	c) prod
	
2) The SG should have appropriate inbound rules such as : SSH , HTTP & Custom TCP(8080).

3) Execute below commands in both test and prod nodes individually:

sudo su
passwd
abcd123 and abcd1234 respectively.
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
port22-> PermitRootLogin yes -> PasswordAuthentication yes
systemctl restart sshd
apt-get update -y
apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
	
4) Launch the master server with its public IP + :8080 and enter Jenkins UN and PWD.  (http://54.174.131.67:8080/)

5) Add 2 slave nodes to Jenkins master (test-node & prod-node) with appropriate creds and IP addresses.

6) Create a webhook for the repo. to trigger the event successfully.

7) Create a freestyle project in Jenkins with below configurations: (test-job)
	a) SCM - git -> repo link
	b) Build steps -> execute shell -> mkdir -p /tmp/pullcode
                                       git clone -b child https://github.com/Suchendra-jpg/july9th.git /tmp/pullcode
									   
8) Create a freestyle project in Jenkins with below configurations: (prod-job)
	a) SCM - git -> repo link
	b) Build steps -> execute shell -> mkdir -p /tmp/pullcode
                                       git clone -b master https://github.com/Suchendra-jpg/july9th.git /tmp/pullcode
									   
9) When code inside child is edited and committed that will automatically trigger test-job.

10) When code inside master is edited and committed that will automatically trigger prod-job.


Assignment 3:

For the above setup just configure post build action as trigerring prod-job once test-job is successfull.
